# Clustering_Project

This project focuses on clustering analysis of a Kaggle dataset using various techniques and hyperparameters. The primary objective is to explore and apply different clustering algorithms to uncover patterns and groupings within the data.

The project utilizes a Data Version Control (DVC) repository to manage the dataset and experiment tracking. DVC enables versioning and reproducibility, allowing for efficient experimentation and comparison of different clustering approaches.

Key Features and Components:

Clustering Algorithms: The project implements multiple clustering algorithms, such as K-means and DBSCAN. Each algorithm is explored with different hyperparameters to evaluate their performance and identify optimal settings. <br>
Data Preprocessing: Prior to clustering, the dataset undergoes preprocessing steps, including data cleaning, feature scaling, and feature selection as necessary. <br>
Evaluation Metrics: The project employs various evaluation metrics to assess the quality of clustering results, such as silhouette score.
Hyperparameter Optimization: Different hyperparameter settings with search implemented using DVC pipeline. <br>
DVC Repository: The project leverages a DVC repository for version control of the dataset and to manage the experiment tracking, allowing for easy reproduction and sharing of results. <br>
