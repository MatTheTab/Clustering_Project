# Clustering_Project

This project focuses on clustering analysis of a Kaggle dataset using various techniques and hyperparameters. The primary objective is to explore and apply different clustering algorithms to uncover patterns and groupings within the data.

The project utilizes a Data Version Control (DVC) repository to manage the dataset and experiment tracking. DVC enables versioning and reproducibility, allowing for efficient experimentation and comparison of different clustering approaches.

#### Key Features and Components:

<b>Clustering Algorithms: <\b> The project implements multiple clustering algorithms, such as K-means and DBSCAN. Each algorithm is explored with different hyperparameters to evaluate their performance and identify optimal settings. <br>
<br>
<b>Data Preprocessing: <\b> Prior to clustering, the dataset undergoes preprocessing steps, including data cleaning, feature scaling, and feature selection as necessary. <br>
<br>
<b>Evaluation Metrics: <\b> The project employs various evaluation metrics to assess the quality of clustering results, such as silhouette score.
Hyperparameter Optimization: Different hyperparameter settings with search implemented using DVC pipeline. <br>
<br>
<b>DVC Repository: <\b> The project leverages a DVC repository for version control of the dataset and to manage the experiment tracking, allowing for easy reproduction and sharing of results. <br>
